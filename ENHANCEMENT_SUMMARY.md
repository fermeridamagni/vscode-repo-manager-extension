# VS Code Repo Manager Extension - Enhancement Summary

## 🎯 Project Status: COMPLETE ✅

All requested formatting issues have been fixed and significant enhancements have been added to the VS Code Repo Manager extension.

## 📝 Original Issues Fixed

### ✅ Release Notes Formatting

- **Issue**: Release notes appearing as single lines without proper formatting
- **Solution**: Updated `generateReleaseNotes()` and `generateConsolidatedReleaseNotes()` methods to properly add empty lines between sections and format output correctly

### ✅ CHANGELOG.md Content

- **Issue**: CHANGELOG.md not showing actual changes content
- **Solution**: Enhanced `organizeReleaseNotesForChangelog()` method to properly filter and map emoji labels to Keep a Changelog sections

### ✅ Duplicate "Changed" Headings

- **Issue**: Duplicate "Changed" headings in changelog
- **Solution**: Improved changelog entry format to include package names for scoped packages: `## [${packageInfo.name}@${newVersion}]`

### ✅ URL Encoding Issues

- **Issue**: URL encoding inconsistencies for scoped packages
- **Solution**: Removed unnecessary `encodeURIComponent()` for scoped package tag URLs, ensuring GitHub links work properly with @ symbols

### ✅ Missing Git Commits

- **Issue**: Missing git commits for package.json and CHANGELOG.md updates
- **Solution**: Implemented `commitVersionChanges()` method to automatically commit package.json and CHANGELOG.md updates before creating release tags

## 🚀 Major Enhancements Added

### 1. Enhanced NPM Publishing with OTP Support

- **Environment Variable Detection**: Checks for NPM_TOKEN, npm_token, NPM_AUTH_TOKEN, npm_config_authtoken
- **Multi-level .npmrc Support**: Scans both local and global .npmrc files for authentication
- **Proper OTP Handling**: Interactive terminal for OTP input with user-friendly prompts
- **Better Error Messages**: Detailed error parsing for EOTP, ENEEDAUTH, E403, ENOTFOUND
- **Authentication Methods**: Multiple login options (interactive, token, manual setup)
- **Real Exit Code Handling**: Proper process monitoring for build/test scripts

### 2. Code Quality & Formatting

- **Prettier Integration**: Added Prettier with comprehensive configuration
- **Format on Save**: VS Code settings for automatic formatting
- **Format Scripts**: `pnpm run format` and `pnpm run format:check` commands
- **CI/CD Integration**: Format checking included in package build process

### 3. Improved Development Workflow

- **Build Pipeline**: Enhanced with formatting → type checking → linting → building
- **Watch Mode**: Separate watch tasks for ESBuild and TypeScript
- **VS Code Integration**: Proper settings for Prettier, ESLint, and TypeScript
- **Output Channels**: Better debugging with output capture and display
